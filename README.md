# Yes We Kanban Board

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About

I decided to make another project to help assist myself with creating even more projects. I decided to create a Kanban board. It can authenticate users via Google or Github and can even anonymously login people. This will be good as I can keep track of my projects and their status when I'm not at home.

## Project Status

## Challenges

Through the development of my project I ran into a few challenges:

- I used a few 3rd party libraries to implement some parts of the website
  - Using Atlassian's DND was a struggle at first but thankfully they had good documentation (and even videos!) to assist me.
- I struggled learning how to understand redux but after more use I understood it

## What I learnt

- Redux
- Atlassian's DND
- Google Firebase
